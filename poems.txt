Avocados are bumpy,
But guac can be smooth.
Unless making it lumpy,
Is your go-to move.
Guac’s always the right call,
For gatherings short and long.
Because a good guac can fix all,
No matter what’s wrong.
And with the main ingredient
Always in season,
This can make things expedient
If you demand guac for any reason.
There’s no need to be grumpy,
You’ve got nothing to prove.
Good guac will make you less jumpy,
So you can just chill and groove.
